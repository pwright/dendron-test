# entityTypes.listener.attributes.cost.description

For the &#39;inter-router&#39; role only.  This value assigns a cost metric to the inter-router connection.  The default (and minimum) value is one.  Higher values represent higher costs.  The cost is used to influence the routing algorithm as it attempts to use the path with the lowest total cost from ingress to egress.
