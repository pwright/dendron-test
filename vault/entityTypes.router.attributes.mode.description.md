# entityTypes.router.attributes.mode.description

In standalone mode, the router operates as a single component.  It does not participate in the routing protocol and therefore will not cooperate with other routers. In interior mode, the router operates in cooperation with other interior routers in an interconnected network.  In edge mode, the router can make a connection to an interior router and join a network without causing that network to recompute paths.
