# entityTypes.vhostUserGroupSettings.attributes.targets.description

A list of target addresses to which users in this group may send messages. To specify multiple addresses, separate the addresses with either a comma or a space. If you do not specify any addresses, users in this group are not allowed to send messages to any addresses. You can use the substitution token &#39;&#39; to specify an address that contains a user&#39;s authenticated user name. You can use an asterisk (&#39;*&#39;) wildcard to match one or more characters in an address. However, this wildcard is only recognized if it is the last character in the address name. You may specify attributes &#39;targets&#39; or &#39;targetPattern&#39; but not both at the same time.
