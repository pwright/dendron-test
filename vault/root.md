With Skupper, you create a service network for your application that isn't limited by the current networkings context, local, data center, or cloud.
Forget VPNs, VPCs, etc, you can create a service in one Kubernetes or Docker instance and use that service anywhere.

Use the protocols you're familar (TCP, HTTP1&2) with the routing capabilities of Apache Qpid Dispatch Router to:

* bring the network to the application
* name all the things
* understand your networking requirements
