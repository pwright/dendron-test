[The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist\" - Vannevar Bush, 1945\n\nEvery knowledge management tool today suffers from the problem of **information overload** - the more information you put in, the harder it becomes, **as a human**, to get any of it back out again.\n\nThe burning need for a tool that would not only overcome this problem but actually work better in the presence of more information was the basis of this project.\n\n# (Hierarchical) Solution\n\n## Hierarchies\n\nDendron proposes **hierarchies** as the **human solution** to information overload. This is because there are few things as effective as a multi-level hiearchy for quickly filtering an overwhelming amount of information to something humans can work with. You can read [this blog post](https://kevinslin.com/organizing/its_not_you_its_your_knowledge_base/) for the extended rationale behind this.\n\nIn Dendron, you can quickly **lookup** related notes by their hierarchy. Hierarchies are simply `.` delimited filenames, similar to the hierarchies made by domain names (eg. `github.com`).\n\nThe following are a few notes that have this hierarchical naming format.\n\n```\n- cli.tar.md\n- cli.tar.env.md\n- cli.curl.md\n- cli.dig.md\n```\n\n## Lookup\n\n**Lookup** is the process of finding a note by traversing its hierarchy.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-cli.gif)\n\n> Lookups are **quick**\n\nWhat's nice about using the `.` delimited format is that a note **can be** both **a file** (something that contains data) and **a folder** (something that contains other files) **at the same time**.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-folder_and_file.gif)\n\n> You **can** be a file and have your folder **too**\n\nDendron uses fuzzy matching on paths so you don't have to type out the whole path.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-fuzzy.gif)\n\n> Lazyness is the key to success\n\nYou can use **lookup** to figure out what is true!\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-bool.gif)\n\n## Schemas\n\nIf you're paying close attention, you might have noticed some icons popup during lookup.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-closeup.jpg)\n\nThese icons indicate the **schema** associated with the note. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.\n\nYou can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml` to your workspace.\n\nBelow is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don't need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following [glob patterns](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/): `cli.*`, `cli.*.cmd`, `cli.*.cmd.*`, `cli.*.env`\n\n```yml\n- id: cli\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  parent: root\n  data:\n    namespace: true\n  children:\n    - cmd\n    - env\n- id: env\n  desc: variables relevant for command\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands\n  data:\n    namespace: true\n```\n\nSchemas help you organize your notes by letting you know what comes next.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-suggest.gif)\n\nThe `+` sign next to the suggestion indicates that the note does not exist but is part of the schema.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-plus.jpg)\n\n**Schema suggestions** don't show you an endless lineup of tags or folders - they only show you suggestions scoped to your specific level of the hierarchy that you are looking at.\n\nThe nice thing about these suggestions is that you can also ignore them.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-ignore.gif)\n\n> Sometimes ~~rules~~ schemas are meant to be broken\n\nDendron will show you a `?` next to the result in future results but otherwise will assume that you know best.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-question.jpg)\n\n## VS Code\n\nDendron is built on top of VSCode, the open-source IDE from Microsoft.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/code-banner.jpg)\n\nDendron runs as a plugin inside VSCode. If you use VSCode today, it means that all your current knowledge, settings and extensions will carry over into Dendron. If you don't, no sweat, because Dendron will create an optimal workspace with recommended settings and extensions when you first launch it.\n\n## Recommended Extensions\n\nSince Dendron runs on top of VSCode, it means that you also have access to thousands of extensions to customize Dendron exactly how you like it.\n\nBy default, Dendron will initialize your first workspace with the following extensions and features.\n\n- [Markdown Notes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n  - [wiki links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n  - [tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n  - [backlinks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes) (think Roam)\n- [Markdown Shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mdickin.markdown-shortcuts)\n  - Quickly toggle bullet points\n  - Easily generate URLs\n  - Convert tabular data to tables\n- [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)\n  - [live markdown preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)\n  - [math](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/math) (KaTeX or MathJax)\n  - [sequence diagrams](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/diagrams?id=mermaid) (mermaid)\n  - [pandoc support](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/pandoc)\n  - [code chunks](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/code-chunk)\n  - [presentations](https://rawgit.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/master/docs/presentation-intro.html)\n- [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=equinusocio.vsc-material-theme)\n  - beautiful colors built using the [Material design system](https://material.io/)\n- [Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image)\n  - easily add images from your clipboard to your markdown files\n- [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright)\n  - Spell Check\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThe following extensions also work well with Dendron but are not bundled by default. You can download them separately to unlock additional functionality.\n\n- [Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) 🔍\n  - Repository/File/Line history and annotations of all your files\n- [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)\n  - VIM key bindings 😍\n- [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks)\n  - Bookmark lines within files\n\n# Et cetera\n\nHopefully, this has been enough to give you a sense of what you can do with Dendron. This project is about 1% complete, both in the sense that it is in **preview** but also that there's so much more to build. The north star of this project is to achieve _Vannevar Bush's_ original vision - to build a tool of thought that can give humanity _\"**access to** and **command over** the inherited **knowledge of the ages**\"_.\n\nIf you are reading this, you too, are now part of the journey. Let's take back control of our information and use it to build something better, together!\n\n# Getting Started\n\nDendron can be installed as a [vscode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dendron.dendron). If you don't already have VSCode, you can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\nAfter you have downloaded the plugin, following the instructions to create your first **workspace**.\n\n1. Launch the _command bar_:\n\n- <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf\">Linux</a> `Ctrl+SHIFT+P`\n- <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf\">macOS</a> `CMD+SHIFT+P`\n- <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf\">Windows</a> `Ctrl+SHIFT+P`\n\n2. Paste the following command and press `Enter`:\n\n```sh\n> Dendron: Initialize Workspace\n```\n\n![Initialize workspace](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/dendron-init.gif)\n\nWhen the workspace opens, it will show dialogue to install the recommended extensions. Though not required, these extensions add all the **non-core** features of Dendron like wiki links and tagging support.\n\n# FAQ\n\nSee [FAQ](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-template/blob/master/vault/dendron.faq.md) to answers for common questions.\n\n# Contributing\n\nWe welcome community contributions and pull requests.

Make sure you have the necessary extensions by checking searching for `@enabled dendron` inside the extensions pane and making sure that you have the latest version of all dendron extensions.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble-extensions.jpg)\n\n\n## Markdown Preview\n\n### Why can't I click the checkbox?\n\nIt could be that you are using the VSCode default markdown instead of Dendron's Markdown Preview. \n\nThey both have identical icons and its currently not possible to disable the builtin preview (we are looking into fixing this [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/42)).\n\nMeanwhile, you can open Dendron's markdown preview by clicking the preview button on the left of the menu bar or by using the `> Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Preview to the Side` command\n\n![Markdown preview](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble-md.png)\n\n## Misc\n\n### Why does Dendron create `root.*` files in my vault?\n- Dendron currently creates a `root.md` file and a `root.schema.yml` file where you initialize your vault. these files will be used in the future to automatically generate an index of everything in your vault. you may safely ignore them for now\n\n### What is the extra text that is created at the beginning of each note?\n- currently, you might see the following text added to the top of your note. This is additional metadata that Dendron uses to manage your files. \n\n```yml\n---\nid: 4407f75d-7334-47a5-9f19-18b458618136\ntitle: dendron.lookup.hello\ndesc: ''\nupdated: 1594078624566\ncreated: 1594078624566\ndata: {}\ncustom: {}\nfname: dendron.lookup.hello\nparent: null\nchildren: []\n---\n```\n\n### Why are there two `book` icons that do markdown preview?\n\nWe use an extension to do markdown preview. VSCode comes with its default markdown preview extension and its not currently possible to hide the button. You can re-open and upvote the issue [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/86994) if you want to fix this.\n\n### How are hierarchies created?\n\nHierarchies today are created automatically when dendron crawls your folder for `.` delimited file names and custom schema.yml files.","url":"http://localhost:8080/notes/a6c03f9b-8959-4d67-8394-4d204ab69bfe.html","relUrl":"notes/a6c03f9b-8959-4d67-8394-4d204ab69bfe.html"},{"doc":"Topics","title":"Topics","hpath":"dendron.topic","content":"\n# Topics\n\n","url":"http://localhost:8080/notes/7a7af2fa-b9d0-4adc-81e6-f03186123539.html","relUrl":"notes/7a7af2fa-b9d0-4adc-81e6-f03186123539.html"},{"doc":"Workspace","title":"Workspace","hpath":"dendron.topic.workspace","content":"\n\n# Workspace\n\nIn Dendron, your **workspace** is the root of where all your files are located.

This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes at scale. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your notes.

You don't need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following [glob patterns](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/): `cli.*`, `cli.*.cmd`, `cli.*.cmd.*`, `cli.*.env`\n\n```yml\n# an id identifies a particular node in the schema\n- id: cli\n  # human readable description of hierarchy\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  # this means this node is the domain of this hierarchy\n  parent: root\n  data: \n    # when a schema is a namespace, it can have arbitary children. equivalent to cli.* glob pattern\n    namespace: true \n  children:\n    - cmd\n    - env\n# will match cli.*.env\n- id: env\n  desc: cli specific env variables\n# will match cli.*.cmd.*\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands \n  data: \n    namespace: true\n```\n\nAfter you've created a schema, you'll need to run [[> Dendron: Reload Index| dendron.topic.commands]] for it to take affect. \n\n# Stub\n\nStubs are notes that don't exist but will show up in lookup results. There are two reasons why these notes might show up: \n- they are the parent of a note deeper in the hierarchy (eg. `foo.bar` might be a stub for `foo.bar.foobar`)\n- they are possible notes according to the schema\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-plus.jpg)\n> The `+` sign next to the suggestion indicates that the note is a stub and does not exist \n\n# Unknown Schema\n\nDendron doesn't force you to use schemas if you don't want to. This is why you can create notes that don't match any schema. Dendron will show you a `?` next to these results.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-question.jpg)\n\n> Sometimes ~~rules~~ schemas are meant to be broken\n\n\n##  Next\nNext, we're going to discuss additional capabilities you can do in Dendron under [[dendron.topic.capabilities]]\n","url":"http://localhost:8080/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html","relUrl":"notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html"},{"doc":"Publishing","title":"Publishing","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing","content":"\n# Publishing\n\nDendron lets you publish the contents of your vault, either in its entirety or only a subset.

From here, you can select from one of our builtin pods or use a third party pod (COMING SOON).\n\n## Builtin Pods\n\n### LocalFile Pod\n\nThis pod imports files stored in your local file system. To get started, select `LocalFile Pod` in the pod dropdown and enter the path to `root` directory where your notes are stored.\n\nThe `LocalFile` pod finds all files from the `root`, and copies over the files into your vault, cleaning the file names to fit dendron's naming hierarchy.

When you lookup for a note that hasn't been created, Dendron will create it for you. \n\nTo try it yourself, bring up the lookup bar. Type `dendron.lookup.hello` and hit `Enter`.\n\nDendron is all about reducing the friction between you and the information you care about. Therefore, there is no difference between entering and looking for information.\n\nAfter you've created the note, you can click the 'x' next to the tab to come back to this screen.\n\n\n## Deleting Notes\n\nTo delete `dendron.lookup.hello`, use the `CMD-SHIFT-D` shortcut on the note that you want to delete. Alternatively, you can also launch the `Command Bar` and type `Dendron: Delete Node` \n\n\nAfter a note has been deleted, we automatically surface the parent note (in this case, [[dendron.topic.lookup]]).\n","url":"http://localhost:8080/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html","relUrl":"notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html"},{"doc":"Links","title":"Links","hpath":"dendron.topic.links","content":"# Links\n\nDendron supports multiple types of links and formats. \n\n- [markdown links](./dendron.md)\n- [[wiki links | dendron]]\n- [url links](https://github.com/orgs/dendronhq/projects/1)\n- images\n    - ![image links](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/logo-256.png)\n\n- links to [local files](assets/think.pdf) (eg. pdfs, psds, etc)\n\nFor markdown and wiki links pointing to markdown files, Dendron will open it up inside the editor.

You can read more about the thoughts behind this [here](https://kevinslin.com/organizing/its_not_you_its_your_knowledge_base/).\n\n## What's with the `.`'s?\n\n\n1. It allows each **file** to also be a **folder**. This means your notes can have data but also contain other notes. \n1. It makes it much easier to perform certain refactoring operations\n    - for example, say you had the following [[schema |dendron.topic.schema]]\n    ```yml\n    - id: a-parent\n    children:\n        - child-a\n        - child-b\n    - id: child-a\n    - id: child-b\n    ```\n    - lets say you wanted to make `child-b` a child of `child-a`\n    ```yml\n    - id: a-parent\n    children:\n        - child-a\n    - id: child-a\n    children:\n        - child-b\n    - id: child-b\n    ```\n    - with the classical folder hierarchy, you would need to turn `child-a` into a folder and then create a custo file to hold the content from the original `child-a`\n    ```\n    .\n    └── a-parent\n        └── child-a\n            ├── child-a-note\n            └── child-b\n    ```\n    - with the `.` delimited hierarchy, this becomes a simple rename operation\n    ```\n    .\n    ├── a-parent.child-a\n    └── a-parent.child-a.child-b\n    ```\n1. It allows us to create [[stubs | dendron.topic.schema ]] for parts of the hierarchy that don't exist and not clutter our file system with empty folders \n    - with the classical folder hierarchy\n    ```\n    .\n    └── a-parent\n        └── child-a\n            └── grandchild-a\n                └── great-grandchild-a.md\n    ```\n    - with the `.` delimited hierarchy\n    ```\n    .\n    └── a-parent.child-a.grandchild-a.great-grandchild-a.md\n    ```\n","url":"http://localhost:8080/notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409.html","relUrl":"notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409.html"},{"doc":"Graph-view","title":"Graph-view","hpath":"dendron.topic.graph-view","content":"\n# 🚧 Graph View\n\nDendron provides support for graph view using a fork of the [markdown-links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links) extension.

It is meant to help you organize, manage, publish, and collaborate on knowledge bases of any size.\n\n### How is Dendron different from X note taking tool?\n\nSubstitute X with `roam|obsidian|foam|one note|evernote|...`\n\nDendron is focused on helping you **organize your notes inside your knowledge base**.\n\nAll note taking tooks (try to make it) easy to get notes in. Its getting it back out again that's hard and it **becomes harder** as you get more notes.\n\nWhether you are using notebooks tags, or backlinks, once you have more than a few hundred notes, you'll need to have some sort of structure in place (eg. naming convention, hierarchy, etc) to keep track of it. \n\nDendron provides that **structure**. We make it possible for you to keep track of knowledge bases of any size, \n\nis designed to help you track your notes using hierarchies and enforce a consistent structure across your knowledge base. As an example, the author [@kevins8](https://twitter.com/kevins8) uses Dendron to manage +20K notes. \n\n\n### How does Dendron help me track my notes?\n\n1. Dendron organizes and collapse all your  notes into managable chunks using [[hiearchies | dendron.topic.hierarchies ]].\n2. Dendron helps you manage your hiearchies using [[schemas | dendron.topic.schema ]]\n3. Dendron gets out of your way when your working with your notes during [[lookup |dendron.topic.lookup]]\n\nYou can read more about how all of this comes together in the [[ zen of dendron |dendron.zen]].\n\n## Working with notes\n\n### Why markdown?\n\nMarkdown lets you write text in a simple human readable notation that is platform independent. You don't need to have microsoft word to read a markdown file and now a days, all new note taking tools support importing and displaying markdown.\n\nFor more context, you can see the original markdown declaration [here]( https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) \n\n### Can I use Dendron with existing notes?\n\nYou can use Dendron with existing repositories of markdown notes.\n\nOpen the `Command Bar` in vscode and use the `Dendron: Change Workspace` command. It will ask you for a folder path as input.\n\nDendron will create a `dendron.code-workspace` file in specified directory and then open the workspace (if a workspace file already exists, it will use that). It will also create a `root.md` file in that directory if it doesn't exist (currently this is part of the internal working of dendron).\n\nDendron **does not** delete or overwrite any files during the **Change Workspace** operation.\n\n### How do I save?\n\nDendron automatically saves when you change focus (switch tabs or applications). You can also manually save using `CMD+S` or `CTRL+S` depending on your operating system\n","url":"http://localhost:8080/notes/683740e3-70ce-4a47-a1f4-1f140e80b558.html","relUrl":"notes/683740e3-70ce-4a47-a1f4-1f140e80b558.html"},{"doc":"Demo","title":"Demo","hpath":"dendron.demo","content":"\n","url":"http://localhost:8080/notes/d14ff02a-c80a-49b1-886e-5125c31c129a.html","relUrl":"notes/d14ff02a-c80a-49b1-886e-5125c31c129a.html"},{"doc":"Scratch","title":"Scratch","hpath":"dendron.demo.scratch","content":"\n- a scratch note: [[foo | scratch.2020-07-24-090054]]\n- a scratch note with a title:  [[scratch.2020-07-24-090107]]\n- [[a scratch note from a link | scratch.2020-07-24-090117]] \n","url":"http://localhost:8080/notes/e8969817-77c8-4943-bbad-d368997157cf.html","relUrl":"notes/e8969817-77c8-4943-bbad-d368997157cf.html"},{"doc":"Cook","title":"Cook","hpath":"dendron.cook","content":"# Cookbook\n\n### Use Dendron with a current workspace\n\nCopy the settings in this [sample workspace](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-template/blob/master/dendron.code-workspace) file.

Note that features with 🚧 are still under active development and might not be fully implemented.\n\n### Markdown\n\nDendron supports markdown, a popular markup syntax that is like HTML but 1000x simpler. If you are new to markdown, you can read about the syntax [here](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).\n\n### Frontmatter\n\nFrontmatter is [YAML](https://yaml.org/) that you can add to the front of your markdown file. It was first introduced by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) and is a convenient way of adding metadata to your plaintext documents. \n\nYou can read more about the frontmatter used in Dendron [[here |dendron.topic.frontmatter]]\n\n### Workspace\nIn Dendron, your **workspace** is the root of where all your files are located. It's definde by the `dendron.rootDir` property and created when you first run `Dendron: Initialize Workspace`\n\n### Vaults 🚧\nYour workspace is made up of **vaults**. You can think of a vault like  a git repository. By default, Dendron creates a *vault.main* folder when you first initialize a **workspace**. All your notes are stored on a per vault basis.\n\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    ├── vault.main\n    │   ├── foo.md\n    │   ├── foo.one.md\n    │   └── foo.two.md\n    └── vault.secret (hypothetical)\n        ├── secret.one.md\n        └── secret.two.md\n```\n\nBy default, when you look for notes in dendron, it will search over all vaults.\n\n### Hierarchies\n\nWithin a vault, your notes are stored **hierarchically** as `.` delimited markdown files. \n\nBelow is a hypothetical hierarchy for a file tree:\n\n```\n.\n└── project1/\n    ├── project1/designs/\n    │   └── project1/designs/promotion.png\n    ├── project1/paperwork/\n    │   └── project1/paperwork/legal.md\n    └── project1/tasks/\n        ├── project1/tasks/task1.md\n        └── project1/tasks/task2.md\n```\n\n\nThe same hiearchy in Dendron would look like the following:\n\n```\n.\n├── project1.md\n├── project1.designs.md\n├── project1.designs.promotion.md\n├── project1.paperwork.md\n├── project1.paperwork.legal.md\n├── project1.tasks.md\n├── project1.tasks.task1.md\n└── project1.tasks.task2.md\n```\n\nYou can read more about hierarchies [[here |dendron.topic.hierarchies]]\n\n### Domain\n\nA domain is the root of a hierarchy. In the example below, `project1` would be the domain.\n\n\n```\n.\n├── project1.md\n├── project1.designs.md\n├── project1.designs.promotion.md\n├── project1.paperwork.md\n├── project1.paperwork.legal.md\n├── project1.tasks.md\n├── project1.tasks.task1.md\n└── project1.tasks.task2.md\n```\n\n### Schema  \n\nAs you end up creating more notes, it can be hard to keep track of it all. This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy. \n\nYou can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml` to your workspace. \n\nBelow is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don't need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following [glob patterns](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/): `cli.*`, `cli.*.cmd`, `cli.*.cmd.*`, `cli.*.env`\n\n```yml\n- id: cli\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  parent: root\n  data: \n    namespace: true\n  children:\n    - cmd\n    - env\n- id: env\n  desc: variables relevant for command\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands \n  data: \n    namespace: true\n```\n\n### Command Bar\n\nThe command bar is native to `vscode`. You can use it to run dendron commands, which will all be prefixed with `Dendron:`. You can use the following shortcut to open the command bar. \n\n- <img src=\"https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/favicon.png\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf\">Linux</a> `Ctrl+SHIFT+P`\n- <img src=\"https://developer.apple.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf\">macOS</a> `⌘+SHIFT+P`\n- <img src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf\">Windows</a> `Ctrl+SHIFT+P`\n\n\n### Lookup Bar\n\nThe lookup bar is how you interact with notes inside of Dendron. Use it to create, find, and delete notes. You can type `> Dendron: Lookup` in the `Command Bar` or use the `CTRL+L` shortcut. \n\n- <img src=\"https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/favicon.png\" width=16 height=16/> <a

Overview\n\ndig (domain information groper) is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers. It performs DNS lookups and\ndisplays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Most DNS administrators use dig to\ntroubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend to\nhave less functionality than dig.\n\n# Synopsis\n\n```sh\ndig [@server] [-b address] [-c class] [-f filename] [-k filename] [-m] [-p port#] [-q name] [-t type] [-v] [-x addr] [-y [hmac:]name:key] [-4] [-6] [name] [type] [class] [queryopt...]\n```\n\n# Options\n- [no]trace:\n  - dig will act as the recursive nameserver: it  will make iterative queries to nameservers and follow referrals from the root, showing each step along the way\n- [no]short\n- [no]recurse\n    - default: true\n- [no]trace \n    - default: false\n\n\n# Example\n\n```sh\n\ndig google.com\n\n; <> DiG 9.3.3rc2 <> www.google.com\n; (1 server found)\n;; global options: printcmd\n;; Got answer:\n;; ->>HEADER<;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 3, ADDITIONAL: 3\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;www.google.com.
